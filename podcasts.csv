Chris and I were two IV heroin addicts who loved to talk about all the coke we smoked, snorted and shot, all the pills we ate, smoked, all the weed we smoked and ate, all the booze we consumed and all the consequences we suffered. After making the show for 2 and a half years, Chris tragically relapsed and died from a fentanyl overdose. Dopey continued on, at first to mourn the horrible loss of Chris, but then to continue our mission - which was at its core, to keep addicts and alcoholics company. Whether to laugh at our time in rehab, or cry at the worst missteps we made, Dopey tells the truth about drugs, addiction and recovery. We continually mine the universe for stories rife with debauchery and highlight serious drug taking and alcoholism. We also examine different paths toward addiction recovery. We shine a light on harm reduction and medication assisted treatment.

Arts & Entertainment,entertainment,La Chute de Lapinville - Une fiction quotidienne,"Tous les jours 5 minutes de vérité, d’aventure, de cynisme, de dépression, d’humour et d’amour (non en vrai, il n’y a pas beaucoup d’amour, mais il y a quand même un peu de sexe.) Alors voilà le pitch.  Lapin a 38 ans, il est cynique et déprimé, un peu amer aussi et il semblerait qu’il soit responsable d’une catastrophe qui a causé la fin du monde. Il décide de nous raconter comment le cataclysme est arrivé, mais pour ça il doit remonter le temps. D’autres narrateurs vont l’aider à reconstituer le puzzle.  L’histoire commence donc le jour où on lui supprime les allocations qu’il touchait en sa qualité de pervers narcissique. Pour tenter de les récupérer, il doit s’engager dans un programme de podcast thérapie qui ne l’inspire pas du tout. C’est le début de la fin et il est contraint de retourner vivre chez ses parents souriants et indifférents, Christiane et Christian, à Lapinville. De retour dans cette ville qui lui donne le bourdon et installé dans le garage de ses parents, les mauvais souvenirs remontent. C’est à ce moment-là qu’il décide de faire de son podcast l’instrument de sa vengeance. Ses anciens camarades de classe vont payer pour les humiliations qu’il a subies quand il était petit. Il élabore un plan machiavélique. Ce résumé contient beaucoup trop de spoilers, mais le spécialiste consulté par ARTE a dit qu’il fallait un résumé de 4000 signes pour que la série soit bien référencée sur les plateformes, donc déso.  Lapin est bientôt rejoint par Chloé Bloomington, star de cinéma qu’un énorme shitstorm oblige elle aussi à revenir dans sa ville natale pour l’inauguration d’un rond-point à son effigie et aussi pour jouer dans une fiction quotidienne audio à la con. Elle est aussi l’égérie des pâtés Legroin qui ont fait la fortune de son père Georges Legroin. Elle se retrouve d’ailleurs prise dans les filets de l’autorité de maladive de Georges, qui la manipule et qui l’exploite, mais aussi dans ceux de Camille Bourdin, la reine du podcast et de la toxicité. Le tournage se transforme en cauchemar.  Puis, c’est Spiruline qui reprend le fil de l’histoire. Astucieuse stagiaire à la mairie, d’une bonne humeur et d’un optimisme inébranlable, elle est totalement exploitée par la maire de Lapinville qui est nulle en informatique mais super forte en corruption et en malversations. Heureusement, Spiruline est surtout une sorte détective dans l’âme qui dévoilera des intrigues insoupçonnées dans les plus hautes sphères de Lapinville… Du coup la mafia locale s’en mêle et des disparitions mystérieuses se succèdent. C’est du moins ce que croit la personne qui écrit ce résumé et qui n’a pas encore lu tous les épisodes, qui sont écrits par des ordinateurs enfermés dans une pièce secrète et qui refusent qu’on les dérange, et qui prennent tout mal, dès qu’on veut changer une toute petite chose (comme le titre) ça les fait vriller alors, on aime mieux les laisser tranquilles. Les destins entremêlés de tous ces personnages forment une pelote visible de l’espace dont cette série, cinq minutes par jour, va dérouler le fil.  Alors écoutez et vous ferez bientôt la connaissance de Sami l’ingé-son fan de reggae, du Robot Français Moyen, de Pif le chien, d’une journaliste sans scrupule, d’une assistante sociale qui est aussi cétologue et stagiaire à la mairie, d’un jardinier gréviste, d’un comédien qui fait des clins d’œil, de mafieux érudits, d’un collégien geek et woke et d’un footballeur volage.  Il y aura des courses poursuites, des effets spéciaux, des concours de popularité, des conflits générationnels, du mystère, des enquêtes, de la politique locale, de la corruption, des fêtes, de la dystopie, de l’humour noir, des chansons, des groupes de parole, des avant-premières, des inaugurations, des traumas, des coups de feu, des goûters, des kidnappings, des rires, des larmes et même des scènes de crime. Et vous saliverez à l’idée de découvrir la spécialité culinaire de Lapinville, le chichoucha.  Parce que finalement « La chute de Lapinville » c’est vous, c’est nous, c’est la classe moyenne, c’est la France, c’est la collapsologie, c’est tout l’univers, des petits riens aux grandes questions existentielles, c’est la retraite, l’épilation et le harcèlement scolaire, c’est la comédie et la tragédie, c’est le monde entier dans un podcast addictif. Une variante des « Simpson » à la sauce rond-point ou un jumeau maléfique de « Plus belle la vie ».",ARTE Radio,179,3TCrKXN5EcaDm7swexlsSs,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a0708994b4b2dd31edc75e224

Arts & Entertainment,education,Literature and History,"With millions of downloads, hundreds of hours of soundtracked content, and an overall emphasis on the cultural history behind famous works of literature, Literature and History is one of the most popular independent podcasts on its subject. Starting with Sumerian cuneiform in 3,100 BCE, Literature and History moves forward in chronological order through Assyriology, Egyptology, the Old Testament, Ancient Greece and Rome, and the birth of Christianity. The show's current season is on Late Antiquity (or 200-700 CE) and the dawn of the Middle Ages.  A typical episode (they average about two hours) features a general introduction to a work of literature, then a full summary of that work that expects no prior knowledge, and finally, an analysis of the cultural, biographical, and historical forces that gave rise to the work in question. Original symphonic and ambient background music is woven throughout each show, and all episodes offer free full, illustrated, footnoted transcriptions as well as quizzes for purposes of review. The show has no advertisements, and its host takes pride in a professional approach that avoids chitchat and ephemera and gets straight to the educational content. You can listen to the episodes in any order, although most listeners begin at the beginning and proceed from there, as the podcast itself is chronologically organized.  Doug Metzger finished his Ph.D. in literature in 2011. His chief scholarly interest, following his dissertation work, continues to be 19th-century realism and postbellum American philosophy.",Doug Metzger,105,2URS1nmmvvbXY7v7oDx23E,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8ac4d395e716063d445d924f51

But when you have the chance to drink some gin made by Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson AKA “The Mountain”, you don’t do so in moderation. It may have been the gin talking, but the idea to start a podcast was born. We could’ve let it die once we got back to the US, but instead turned our drunken boasts into action.

Business & Technology,business,Klartext Wirtschaft - Der Podcast für die Macherinnen und Macher von morgen!,"Andrea Gerhard und Frank Ferchau sprechen Klartext! Die Moderatorin und der geschäftsführende Gesellschafter der ABLE GROUP diskutieren über Zukunftsthemen der deutschen und europäischen Wirtschaft. Es geht um strukturelle Herausforderungen wie zum Beispiel die digitale Transformation oder den Fachkräftemangel. Im Podcast ‚Klartext Wirtschaft‘ soll aber nicht nur der Finger in die Wunde gelegt werden, es geht vor allem um Impulse, hilfreiche Lösungsansätze und den Blick auf die Chancen für den Wirtschaftsstandort Deutschland. Als Chef von Deutschlands führender Unternehmensgruppe für Engineering- und IT-Dienstleistungen teilt Frank Ferchau dabei mit uns seine jahrelange Erfahrung und Expertise.  In jeder Folge bringt Moderatorin Andrea Gerhard Aussagen und polarisierende Statements von Politikerinnen und Politikern, Vordenkerinnen und Vordenkern sowie anderen klugen Köpfen mit. Die Zitate, über die die beiden diskutieren, stammen dabei zum Beispiel von Wirtschaftsminister Robert Habeck, Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz, der Präsidentin der Europäischen Kommission Ursula von der Leyen, Brendan Burke vom Analysehaus PitchBook, dem Digitalexperten Sascha Lobo, von Schriftsteller und Philosoph Richard David Precht, Clemens Fuest, dem Chef des führenden Wirtschaftsforschungs-Instituts ifo, der Wirtschaftsweisen Monika Schnitzer, Sozialphilosoph Frithjof Bergmann oder Wolfgang Grupp, Inhaber des Textilproduzenten TRIGEMA.   Thematisch geht es in den verschiedenen Folgen unter anderem um das Unternehmertum in Deutschland und die Frage, wie wir als Wirtschaftsstandort wieder attraktiver werden können. Andrea Gerhard und Frank Ferchau sprechen darüber, weshalb immer mehr Firmen ihre Produktion ins Ausland verlagern und welche Anreize es braucht, um Unternehmen oder auch Start-ups in Deutschland zu halten. Im Podcast werfen die beiden auch einen Blick über die Landesgrenzen hinaus. Wo stehen wir im internationalen Vergleich und was können wir uns von anderen Nationen vielleicht noch abschauen? Andrea Gerhard und Frank Ferchau diskutieren darüber, wie wir mehr Frauen für MINT-Berufe begeistern können und wie wir qualifizierten Fachkräften aus dem Ausland den Einstieg in den deutschen Arbeitsmarkt erleichtern können.  Themen, die in einem Wirtschafts-Podcast natürlich auch nicht fehlen dürfen: Digitalisierung, Nachhaltigkeit und New Work. Moderatorin Andrea Gerhard und Unternehmer Frank Ferchau sprechen darüber, wie die digitale Transformation gelingen kann und welche Rolle Künstliche Intelligenz dabei spielt. Auch auf unsere Arbeitswelt hat die Digitalisierung einen großen Einfluss. Inwieweit Arbeitnehmende und Arbeitgebende hier Kompromisse schließen müssen, klären wir in einer weiteren Folge.

Ari Taublieb, CFP®, MBA specializes in helping people navigate an early retirement. I get it...retirement sounds overwhelming (an early retirement may sound particularly overwhelming)! Does it just feel like there's so much to consider and you just want to make sure you're doing everything you can to set yourself up right? If I may ask...why do YOU want to retire early? Do you want to travel? Have you just had enough of work? Do you want to spend more time with family (or on hobbies you've been putting off)? I created this podcast to help you know when work is now optional because you have a financial strategy that tells you when you can retire. You will learn all the investing tips in this financial podcast to set up the right portfolio for your goals. You may love what you do - and if that's you, great! I'm not saying stop working. But, I am saying, wouldn't it be nice to know when you didn't HAVE to work any more? When you would only go to work because you enjoyed it (crazy concept, I know). This is the ultimate retirement podcast (specifically, early retirement!). Retiring early, also known simply as ""financial freedom"", is having the ability to do what you care most about, MORE!I don't want you to work unless you ENJOY it (finances aside, for just a moment)! My goal of this podcast is to give you all the tips and strategies so you can retire EARLY. Retirement planning, investing, personal finance, tax strategy, and you'll hear case studies from my clients and exactly how I've helped them navigate the transition into retirement. What are the right investment accounts to have in retirement? I want retirement planning to be simple for you so that you can retire early and maximize your retirement goals. Become a retiree and enjoy everything you've been waiting for your whole life (and start practicing retirement today)! I release new episodes every Monday with all the strategies (you'll learn that I love examples) so you can maximize your return on life (we use money to do this).","Ari Taublieb, CFP®, MBA",220,4pERLlCzWIB1EqH7aAIc0R,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a0111c2f5976494fe2a81c5d0

Business & Technology,business,Baking it Down with Sugar Cookie Marketing 🍪,"👋 Hey - Heather and Corrie here with the Baking it Down Podcast with Sugar Cookie Marketing (a group on Facebook full of sugar cookiers turned business owners). 🍪 We're here to help you rise with your reach, flood with new followers, bake up new ideas, and make that all-important dough (while makin' that dough - see the pun there?) 🤑. What’s it about? We’re a Facebook Group turned Podcast, Membership, Book Club, and Baking 101 that’s dedicated to assisting bakers in effectively marketing online to generate more sales and better manage their businesses. 🧠 With free Facebook Live classes, hundreds of resources, and thousands of like-minded bakers, there’s a lot to learn in ""SCM"" (aka Sugar Cookie Marketing). ️🎧 As an extension of our Facebook group, this podcast is here to let you learn by listening. 📈 We'll cover group topics, marketing trends, and more (leaving this wide open in case Corrie wants to start singing). 💸 We take the sweet art of selling online to the cottage bakery world with marketing methods that move products (and pastries).👂 So open up those glorious ear canals because we have a podcast! Just when you’ve thought you’ve “heard” it all with those marketing ""miracle"" twins (that's our last name - not a proclamation), we’ve got something just for you each week! 🥣 As a baker, you don't always have the luxury of two hands needed to scroll in Sugar Cookie Marketing Group or crack open a book in Sugar Cookie Bookies, but what you can do is listen (unless you're my kid asking “what’s for dinner” for the millionth time). 👐 Hands full of flour? No problem! 👍 18 dozen iced cookies due tomorrow? Let’s do this. The Baking it Down Podcast by Sugar Cookie Marketing is a weekly podcast geared toward helping you grow your bakery business - dropping (almost) every Tuesday. 📅 We choose a topic each week that's either something new and emerging in the world of social media or something that we saw in ""The Group"" that was a hot topic and we bake it down... I mean, ""break"" it down for you. 🗯️ What you can expect in the podcast is about an hour of chit-chat with the meat and potatoes right at the beginning of the episode. 🥔 That’s when we dive into the marketing topic of the week! 📞 Oh yeah, folks can call / text / email in with their questions too - a fun way to hear from other bakers out there. Our promises to you: 1️⃣ We always make it clean = no cursing. We understand that you are busy and could be around little ones while also trying to get your weekly dose of business growth so we make sure that each episode would make our grandma proud and keep it clean so you can listen while also living your life. 2️⃣ We always make it fun. There’s a lot of negativity in the world so we try and make the podcast an upbeat and fun learning experience for you. I mean, we try to make the Instagram updates and changes as happy as we can, but come on Instagram! Give it a rest! No more changes! 3️⃣ Other than that, we take a positive approach to marketing We are also *not* professional podcasters. I feel like we need to say this because, hey, sometimes we get giggles! We do our best to extend our marketing knowledge to you all free of charge each week at the cost of listening to our higher-than-normal pitched voices and the occasional giggle spree. 4️⃣ You can find the podcast on all the major platforms and you can typically expect a new episode each Tuesday afternoon (unless life happens). We invite everyone to listen. Either start from the beginning or work backward! The episodes don’t build off themselves so you won’t be confused hearing one before the other. You just might miss new Lives we mention but you can always catch the replay in the Sugar Cookie Marketing Group on Facebook!",Heather and Corrie Miracle,192,1Ay5r7C9MEqofIBGJhHdTx,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8ace225f4886810790fadd8432

Business & Technology,science,Technology ,"1. High costs: Investing in new technologies can be expensive and may require upfront costs that your company might be unable to afford. 2. Lack of understanding: Not everyone understands the benefits of new technologies, and employees might be hesitant to use them or see the potential.  Inconsistent availability- Not all technologies are available in all locations or have consistent uptimes. This can be problematic for businesses that rely on these systems to conduct their operations. 3. Loss of control over personal data: As more and more companies rely on AI and machine learning for product recommendations, making recommendations for customers’ “next best actions,” and other functionalities, it is important to understand the risks of handing over personal data to these systems. Disclosing personal information to a third party may violate laws or breach contractual obligations and could put your company at risk for future lawsuits. This can put your company in a precarious position and leave you open to the risks associated with keeping that data in-house. 4. Exposure to malicious attacks: Cyber attacks will continue to rise in the future as hackers find new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in existing systems. Businesses have to be aware of the potential dangers of opening themselves up to these attacks and the possibility of significant financial loss. Cyber attacks have the potential to shut down power grids and other critical infrastructure, disrupt pharmaceutical supply chains, and cause significant damage to businesses that rely on internet-connected systems. This can be incredibly dangerous and costly to a company. 5. Violation of privacy and ethical standards: Many businesses are concerned about potential violations of privacy and ethical standards when considering AI and machine learning. These systems collect and analyze personal data, including information about customers and employees, and may be subject to governmental oversight and regulation. In some cases, using these technologies may require you to obtain consent from individuals whose data you are collecting, and it may be necessary to inform customers about how the data will be used. 6. Automation that leads to job loss: Many of the tasks that are currently being done by people are also being automated by robots and other technologies. This has caused some people to feel concerned that they will lose their jobs to robots and AI. This can cause a significant amount of anxiety and fear among the workforce, and, if it leads to people leaving the company, it can create an issue known as the “labor shortage. he fear of job loss is a legitimate concern, and businesses should be aware of the potential consequences of automation. However, there are ways to mitigate these risks and ensure that job loss is not a significant issue for your business. 7. Loss of personal contact and relationships: Although technology has made many aspects of our lives easier, it has also had a significant impact on the quality of relationships between people. Many people now rely on technology to communicate with loved ones. It is easy to forget that there is more to effective communication than sending a text or an email. There is a risk that people will become less empathetic and compassionate as they are unable to understand face-to-face experiences. 8. Technology dependence:  Technology is a powerful tool, and it can be used to benefit society greatly. However, many people are now dependent on technology, and it can be difficult for them to cope without it. It is possible that this dependence has a negative impact on health and well-being. It may even have an impact on productivity. It is therefore important that people do not become too reliant on technology. After all, it is possible that new devices will emerge that could render your gadgets obsolete. This could make it difficult for you to continue using them",Tonia Singletary,6,01eZBtHHb8LZKdHu2t5GYA,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8abb246d54aee596b9cc0d5abc

The story centers on Finn Caspian, an 8-year-old boy aboard The Famous Marlowe 280 Interplanetary Exploratory Space Station. He and his friends Abigail, Elias and Vale are Explorers Troop 301, taking off from the Marlowe to explore uncharted planets, help the occasional alien, and solve a mystery that threatens to destroy the Marlowe. When pressed, we describe it as a ""mystery gang"" story, sort of like Scooby-Doo in space. The story is written and performed by Jonathan Messinger, author of Hiding Out, former web editor of Time Out Chicago Kids, and father of two boys. His son Griffin, 7, serves as editor of the story, appearing in episodes to critique, make predictions and express skepticism that his father knows what he's talking about, which also happens to be the way the rest of their relationship works.

Educational,science,Growth Mindset Psychology: The Science of Self-Improvement,"There are a lot of opinions on how to master your mind, but then there’s PSYCHOLOGY. We’re all stuck with the brain we’re born with, but we aren’t stuck with how we use it.  Learn science-backed answers to make the most of your mind and your life.  CURIOUS? Growth Mindset Psychology is the ""self-help sceptic"" podcast for the curious. Whether you want to improve performance, navigate setbacks, or know who you are. We find answers to the true science of self-improvement. So put down the astrology chart and start working with your mind, instead of against it. With over 8 million downloads and 60,000 monthly listeners, you’re invited to join.  PROCESS Instead of telling you what to think, we discuss how thinking works. Armed with a stack of science journals, textbooks and a boatload of curiosity, we uncover the mechanics of the mind. Why? >>> Success is personal! You might want to make the most of your neurodiverse strengths, start a business, or simply find more reasons to smile. Hone your ability for independent thinking and growth with mental models to pursue your definition of success.  HOST I’m Sam Webster Harris, a lifelong learner with ADHD, a raging curiosity, and an obsession with finding answers to hard questions. After launching several businesses, travelling the world and nearly dying a few times I concluded that science and Psychology are where it’s at. What actually makes people happy? What’s the best way to treat a brain? How can I get more done? Studying the answers we find that changing behaviours requires building mindsets, mental models, and a healthy relationship with failure.

Bella also shares her own anecdotes and the conversations expand into deeper discussions on life’s universal themes—love, identity, culture, anxiousness, and even politics.Through a series of tailored questions, Bella creates a relaxed, intimate atmosphere where her guests—ranging from fashion icons to cultural figures in sport, art, music and literature reveal more about themselves than they might expect. Fashion is often dismissed as superficial, but in this podcast, it becomes the lens through which we examine our inner lives, relationships, and society.From Kate Moss to other notable guests, Fashion Neurosis with Bella Freud offers a unique, thoughtful, and engaging conversation that goes far beyond what we wear: diving into the unspoken language of clothing and the ways in which we use style to navigate and communicate in the world.www.fashionneurosis.com@fashionnueorsis_bellafreud",Bella Freud,11,5u12Pe78N9yaQWRWWoXZTK,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a8b5c6cfe618ecda491c6aa62

We've traded a life intertwined with nature for asphalt and artificial lights. We've swapped natural movement for a sedentary existence.

Lifestyle & Health,culture,"HER Style Podcast | Shopping, Color Palettes, Fashion, Wardrobe, Outfits, Clothing","The Go-To Podcast for Ambitious Women Who Want to Build Their Dream Wardrobe and Show Up with Confidence!  **TOP 10 FASHION & BEAUTY PODCAST**  Are you sick of having a closet full of clothes and nothing to wear? Have you been wearing and buying the same things on autopilot? Do you struggle to put your pieces together? Do you wish you could get dressed quickly in the morning and feel good as you go about your day?  I’m so glad you’re here! This podcast will give you a clear cut system to elevate your style and put together a capsule wardrobe that feels right for you so you can show up and get dressed every day with confidence!  Hey friend, I’m Heather Riggs, a wife, mom, and 17-year Certified Image Consultant and Color Specialist.  After having my son in 2018, my whole life changed. My clothing didn’t feel right for me anymore. I didn’t have the time or energy to figure it out, so I tried a lot of the quick-fix mistakes you might be making. I copied what the other “cool mom” influencers were wearing on Instagram. I defaulted to preset outfits and cookie-cutter capsule wardrobes that were tailored for someone else and not for me. I ended up feeling even more frustrated and confused about what to wear.  I realized that if I was going to feel confident and excited to get dressed again, I needed to buy less and shop smarter.  So I sat down and mapped out the exact steps I’d taken with my most successful personal styling clients over the years and decided to get to work. Following this simple system, I built my dream wardrobe easily, efficiently, and inexpensively and now I want to help you do the same!  In this podcast, I will teach you how to:  - Figure out and elevate your personal style - Embrace and dress the body you have now so you can stop wasting money on clothes that don’t look good on you - Add more color into your wardrobe with confidence - Get rid of things (without feeling guilty!) and organize your closet - Design a custom capsule wardrobe that reflects where you are in your life - Quit impulse shopping and chasing fashion trends and start finding exactly what you want and need to fill in the gaps - Make the best use of your pieces and style them in new and exciting ways  You don’t have to go out and buy an entire new wardrobe. You just need someone to show you the simple art and science of getting dressed! I’m here to provide you with the practical tools and customized support you need — all with a side order of humor and humility (because fashion isn’t meant to be taken too seriously!).  Get ready to binge hours of free style advice and enjoy getting dressed again!

In the process of growing my business I’ve been fortunate enough to connect with women of all different types and from all different fields. And the main lesson I’ve learnt is that we are all just improvising. We’re going around doing the best we can with what we’ve got, feeling self conscious about what everyone else is accomplishing. The truth is, the people who you’re looking over your shoulder at are probably doing the exact same thing to someone else.

Do you feel guilty when your kiddos invite you to play, but by the time you’ve told them ’just a minute,’ ’hang on,’ or ’let me finish this’, the day has slipped away with no intentional focused time together at all? Does your brain feel like it will never just SHUT OFF with your continuously running to-do list?  I’m SO excited you’re here!! This podcast will help you create simple systems, daily routines, and time management strategies to feel more productive in your days so you can balance running a home AND being fully present for your kiddos.  Hey, I’m KyAnn. A mom, wife, and Jesus lover. For too many years, I let my habits just sort of happen without much intention or thought. I felt constantly behind and I was trying to do it all, but doing NONE of it well. I was chasing business success, achievements, and hustle culture that stole my time and mental health so I didn’t have any extra energy to devote to building intentional habits that kept my priorities in the RIGHT order. I finally realized that if I was going to balance motherhood and homemaking well, I had to find simple routines and systems to serve me in the season I was in.  I created daily rhythms for our family that reflected my priorities and helped me tackle my to-do list, all while allowing me to be fully present with my kiddos - simple systems that when practiced well, even allowed extra time to work on my business during the cracks of time during the day. And now I’m ready to share it all with you!  If you are ready to finally find a routine that works for you…steps to feel more balanced and less overwhelmed in your days as a busy mom…systems that give you your time back, help you to be more present with the people you love most, and finally get your brain to just RELAX-this podcast is for you!

The Holy Quran was the subject of this Imam’s keen interest and learning and hence, it came as no surprise when he memorized the Book of Allah in a few years itself.Besides his melodious and emotional voice, he has managed to grab the attention of the bigwigs in the field of Islamic knowledge such as Sheikh Ibrahim Ali Shehata Al-Samanodi, the Sheikh Abdur Area Radwan, and also the great sheikh Ahmed Abdulaziz Al-Zaiat.The next step was his decision to pursue his higher education at the Islamic and Quranic university of Madinah, Saudi Arabia.  The two famous links of the recitation of the Quran: TV Alafasy and Alafasy Q are managed by this great Imam and rightfully so. In a similar manner, numerous TV channels and radio stations have taken pride in broadcasting all his highly commendable productions.

Lifestyle & Health,culture,Raising Parents with Emily Oster,"Poseidon is the god of the sea, Dionysus of wine and merrymaking, and Emily Oster? She’s the god of parenting.   An economics professor at Brown University, Oster has built a massive and loyal audience by providing overwhelmed parents with the information and data they need to make solid and sound parenting decisions in a very confusing world. Her first book, Expecting Better: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom Is Wrong—and What You Really Need to Know, sold over a million copies and was translated into 19 languages, unseating the classic What to Expect When You’re Expecting as a fixture on many pregnant mothers’ bedtime tables.   In this new series with The Free Press, Oster tackles the deep, difficult, existential, and often controversial questions facing parents today: Are we too soft on kids these days? How do I raise an independent child in an era of overprotection and helicopter parenting? Why are so many teen girls unhappy and anxious, and how can we make them happy again? Why are boys being left behind? Are kids overdiagnosed? What to do about the phones!? Is marriage important for raising kids? Should you even have kids at all?   These questions are more urgent than ever. That’s because, by many measures, kids are worse off today than 30 years ago. They are more anxious than ever. They’re more depressed. They have more diagnoses than ever before. They’re more medicated. More kids are being raised without two parents in the home today. Kids’ reading and math scores haven’t recovered since their decline during the Covid pandemic. Childhood obesity has risen to 19.7 percent. Kids spend on average 7.5 hours in front of a screen for entertainment each day, and the average teen spends around 9 hours a day on their phone.  What’s going on with kids today? How worried should we be about our kids? And what should we be doing, as parents, to change course, before it’s too late? How do we raise good people—which starts with raising good, informed parents—in this strange, new world?   Over eight episodes, Oster speaks with over 50 of the world’s best parenting experts, journalists, doctors, psychologists, researchers, and more including: Dr. Becky, Jonathan Haidt, Pamela Druckerman, Richard Reeves, Hanna Rosin, Abigail Shrier, Bryan Caplan, Christine Emba, Johann Hari, Sami Timimi, Melissa Kearney, Ross Douthat, and many, many more. Oster brings her trusted voice—with its sobriety, wisdom, and humor—to the most challenging parenting questions of the day.   The best way to support this podcast is to become a Free Press subscriber today at TheFP.com/subscribe",The Free Press,9,2Xl6ASfHB74Q6MUH4htklS,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a265ddb6148aa179d31fb937f

Lifestyle & Health,culture,"Motherhood in ADHD – Parenting with ADHD, Productivity Tips, Brain based Science, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Education to Help Moms with Adult ADHD","Productivity, Parenting, and Education for Moms with Adult ADHD  Are you overwhelmed by the never-ending to do list of motherhood? Are you burnt out and barely keeping your head above water? Are you confused and frustrated by how all the other moms make it look so easy? And somehow you're still floundering despite trying even harder...   Your purse is as overflowing as your mind, you never feel like a good enough mom, and you don't dare have anyone over to visit to witness your messy home. You just want the best for your kids, but you can't figure out how to manage the chaos, both in your mind and in your house.  Oh, I've been there, mama. Some days, I'm still there. Parenting with ADHD is hard!   We want to be structured for our kids, yet we can't seem to stay consistent even for ourselves. But I'm letting go of everyone else's perception of a ""good mom"" and stepping into loving who I am a little more each day.  Will you join me?  Whether you have ADHD like I do, or think you might, here is your permission slip to let go of the pinterest worthy visions of organization and structure fit for everyone else. Let's do life like our brains do life: creatively, lovingly, and with all your might. Moms with ADHD have a superpower of always trying their best, even when it doesn't pan out.   How do I know? I have known about my ADD for over twenty years, and I want to share all of this hard-earned ADHD knowledge with you, making your adjustment a lot easier and faster than mine was.   What does Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder look like in women? We'll dive into emotional regulation, motivation, executive function, hormones, medication, and natural treatments. Women with ADHD share their diagnosis stories with us, whether inattentive, hyperactive or combined, from childhood through adult diagnoses. We also talk about ADHD's so-called friends like depression, anxiety, addiction, disordered eating, other learning differences, and what I've learned through therapy and CBT.    Science is my jam and learning about how our brains work through the lens of scientific research helps us understand who we are. ADHD is not just for little boys; it looks different in girls.   Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurological medical condition, not an excuse for lazy, stupid, unmotivated people to not live up to our potential. Let's agree to throw that thought in the trash.  Once we understand how our brains work, we can dive into the practical strategies like structuring our day, minimalism, money, nurturing our relationships, daily rhythms, using a planner, and improving our sleep. I want to help you build your version of a joyful family life.  We talk about everything from ADHD to Zebras, because that is how Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder works: to us, our thoughts are clearly connected, but non-linear to everyone else. I want you to love being a zebra in a world full of horses. We were born as unique, gorgeous creatures, not meant to blend in with the usual nor mundane.   When we embrace who we are and how our brains work, we can figure out how to live out lives successfully and in turn, lead our families well.  At the end of the day, we just want to be good moms.  Spoiler alert: you are already a great mom.   If you're ready to see that with your own two eyes, hit play and listen in as we love ourselves a little more each day of our ADHD lives. ADHD does NOT mean you're doomed to be a hot mess, mama!   You CAN rewrite your story from shame spiral to success story, and I'll be right here beside you to cheer you on!

You deserve it all, you deserve to feel worthy and confident. You deserve a fulfilling love life.  For years I was going through the same experiences with men over and over again that left me feeling confused, anxious, and pissed off.

But none of it was working.  I knew I couldn’t continue to repeat the same cycle with different men.   Something had to change.   I decided in that moment that I was going to finally work on healing my own wounds and work on myself, so that I could experience a beautiful and fulfilling relationship. I decided to put myself first.   And now, with this podcast, I want to share with you the exact internal work strategies that I did to get to a place of confidence, peace, and worthiness.

Lifestyle & Health,culture,Save Your Sanity - Help for Toxic Relationships,"The Save Your Sanity podcast offers episodes filled with the expert insights, validation, strategies, and support you need to recognize, manage, and recover from relationships with the relentlessly difficult, toxic--and often disturbing--people that host Dr. Rhoberta Shaler calls Hijackals®. She offers invaluable help to stop the second-guessing, undermining, and crazy-making traits, patterns, and cycles you have encountered in relationships with folks like those. Understand the ways, whys, and hows that verbal abuse, emotional abuse, and spiritual abuse affect you over time. Whether the Hijackal is a partner, parent, ex, or colleague, what you will learn here will strengthen and empower you to step up, speak up, and stand up for yourself in healthy, assertive ways. Many Hijackals have behaviors that are considered the same as those who are diagnosed as narcissists, borderlines, psychopaths, sociopaths, and histrionic personality disorder. These insights will help you to make the changes--and good decisions--to move from pain to power, and that's exactly what you want to do! Listen now.  Finding value in this content?

Welcome to Rom-Com Vom: where in every episode we go under the covers with a beloved rom-com, strip away its hidden toxic messages, and rewrite the script on love + sex.  --- ABOUT ROM-COM VOM: Did our favorite rom-coms we adored growing up totally warp our ideas about love, relationships, dating, and sex? Spoiler alert: they sure did, and we’re here to talk about it! Join DB (Sex Educator & Pleasure Expert) and her renowned guests like Franchesca Ramsey (Comedian), Logan Ury (Dating Coach), Justine Kay and Natasha Scott-Reichel (Hosts of 2 Black Girls, 1 Rose), Reed Amber and Florence Bark (Hosts of Come Curious), and more as we dissect popular rom-coms like You’ve Got Mail, Never Been Kissed, 10 Things I Hate About You, Twilight, Hitch, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, and more.  --- We’ll dive into the swoon-worthy moments and cringe-worthy toxic lessons, unpacking how these movies shaped (and messed up) our views on healthy relationships and what sex should be like. And don’t worry—we’re rewriting the script with ideas on how these films could’ve done better. This series is perfect for fans of sex-positive podcasts, film nostalgia, feminist cultural critiques, and anyone ready to challenge outdated love tropes. --- Sex Ed with DB is your go-to podcast for smart, science-backed sex education—delivering trusted insights from top experts on sex, sexuality, and pleasure. Empowering, inclusive, and grounded in real science, it’s the sex ed you’ve always wanted. --- ABOUT SEX ED WITH DB: Take a second and think back to the sex education you had in school. Did it prepare you to have a healthy and happy relationship with sex and identity? If it was anything like DB’s, it was stigmatizing, judgmental, and totally unhelpful. But not to worry, the experts are here to offer the sex ed you wish you had. --- We cover an array of sex education topics like orgasms, abortion, pornography, fetishes and kinks, pleasure, consent and boundaries, healthy relationships, LGBTQIA+ mental health and sexual health, LGBTQIA+ relationships, coming out, sexual dysfunction and pain during sex, birth control, sex in the media, Queer stories, and so much more. We believe that everyone deserves comprehensive, inclusive, pleasure-centered, feminist, medically-accurate sex education. On the show, DB and sexual health expert guests break down your most curious sex questions like “Am I pregnant?” or “How can I have a stronger orgasm?” or “How do I keep the spark alive in a long-term relationship?” or “How often should I be having sex?” or “What are common sexual fetishes?” or “What are the benefits of masturbation?” Tune in for expert insights and candid conversations redefining sexual health and empowerment! --- ABOUT DB: Danielle Bezalel (she/her), aka DB, has a Master of Public Health from Columbia University with expertise in sexuality, sexual, and reproductive health. DB is a leading voice in inclusive and medically accurate sex education.

The Rock Fight will dissect the latest headlines to come out of the outdoor industry. We'll weigh in on topics other outdoor media companies avoid like the plague.

Sports & Recreation,sports,Christian Outdoors Podcast,"Christian Outdoors Podcast is owned and operated by Christian Outdoor Adventures, Inc. a 501c3 non-profit operating in Taylors, SC.  In 2019, after a lot of prayer and research, founder and host, Pete Rogers launched Christian Outdoors Podcast with one drive and mission. “To talk about all things outdoors and how to enjoy God every day.”  Through his 25 years as an outdoor writer, author, and speaker. Pete learned that any of the folks in the outdoor arena were Christians without a platform to express their faith. Cable television shied away from overt or subtle mentions of Christianity. Publications were clear, that no mention of God, much less Jesus was not allowed. This left a void for many who live for Christ but who also need to make a living with their product(s).  On October 1, 2019, the first episode was released with the commitment to release one episode a week for one full year and then re-evaluate. After that first year, the momentum was slow, but Pete felt that he needed to keep going.  The model is simple; Pete interviews stakeholders in the outdoor community and they discuss their passion for the outdoors, and we follow that with a discussion about their individual faith journey. On a regular basis, Pete will bring in two pastors who share his passion, tackle tough theological issues, and share their insight into what the Bible says about that particular subject.  Pete has a deep passion for the outdoors, spending more than 200 days a year in the outdoors, hiking, camping, hunting, and fishing wherever he can. But his passion for sharing the good news of Jesus is what drives him to continue to grow the podcast and reach as many people as he can through this medium.  We are just getting started, and with God’s blessing, and the support of key partners, this ministry will continue to grow and reach folks with the good news of Jesus.",Pete Rogers,274,2hgraVV4ZGbkJuUXELBtfa,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a8b063e3ff8be86d7135364a2
